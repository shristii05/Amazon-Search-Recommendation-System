# Amazon Search and Recommendation System
This project implements a product recommendation engine that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to suggest products similar to a user’s search query. The application reads product data from a CSV file, processes textual information using TF-IDF and cosine similarity, and displays results through an interactive Streamlit interface.

The goal of the system is to enhance product discovery by analyzing textual data such as product titles and descriptions. It demonstrates the practical application of NLP in e-commerce search and recommendation systems.
